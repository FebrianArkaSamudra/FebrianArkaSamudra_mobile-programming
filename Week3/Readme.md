**Result :** 
Incorrect Capitalization of Keywords
The keywords if and else must be written in lowercase. Dart is case-sensitive, so using If or Else will result in a syntax error.

Using a String as a Boolean Condition
A String value like "true" cannot be directly used in an if statement. Dart requires a Boolean (true or false) in conditionals. Comparing the string explicitly is necessary.

Duplicate Variable Declaration
Declaring two variables with the same name (test) in the same scope is not allowed. Variable names must be unique within their scope to avoid conflicts and compile-time errors.
